Checkers!
====================
Joseph Gelb and Ari Hatzimemos

Our game is a simple game of checkers, in which you can play against the computer.

To play, follow the commands in terminal.  
Move by typing first the coordinates of the piece you want to move, and then the coordinates of where you want to move.
This is in the format A6 for example.  The first letter represents the row, and the number is the column.
Your row must be a capital letter.  If it is not, you will be prompted for a new move. 

If your piece reaches the other side, it is replaced by a King (K).  Kings can move and capture forwards and backwards.
An enemy King is represented by a $.

If there is a possible double jump, you will be asked if you would like to do the double jump, or stick with a single move. 

The computer moves based on an AI, which has a prioritized set of situations to look for.  

See if you can beat the computer by taking all of its pieces!  We can't beat the game, and we made it, so either the AI is good, or we are really bad at checkers.
